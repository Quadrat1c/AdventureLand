Adventure Land MMO Code Game

## Brief Description of Code
I'm just starting out, idea is to have the warrior as your main player, you can enable the default code or disable and move him around and the others will follow/attack/heal

Will eventually add Auto party, Auto buy potion and auto upgrade items


## TODO:
1. Implement using skills
2. Travel system, Ex: Farming spots, town, etc
3. Auto potion buying (Or have merchant bring pots to party location on request)
4. Auto upgrading (Leave this job to merchant)
5. Auto Merchant shop (Selling/Buying)
